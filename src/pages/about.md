I am a software engineer, analyst, entreupreneur, and maker. I have been working in the tech industry for over 20 years. 
I have a passion for learning new things and building cool stuff. I am regularly working on new projects, but in
many cases, I can't share them. This blog always me to share a small piece of what I'm working.

This site was created using a combination of tools I regularly use and some I'm implementing for the first time. 
<a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a> is a static site web-framework that combines dynamic UI frameworks 
and plain-old HTML/Markdown to generate content. I use <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a> for 
styling in almost all of my current projects. Tailwind allows me to quickly build and style components, while providing flexiblity
to customize them exactly how I want.

My favorite stack for building web applications centers around <a href="https://remix.run/" target="_blank">Remix</a>. Remix is a
full-stack web framework that allows me to build web applications with dynamic content, server side rendering (SSR), and a great
developer experience. Remix is built on top of <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>. I also use 
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>.

One of the things I'm passionate about making is craft beer. If you follow me, you'll see a lot of projects related
to craft beer. Craft breweries make great case studies for data driven technology projects and talking about beer is fun. 
Craft breweries also face an interesting challenge in that the tools they use are niche and unfriendly to integration. Some
of the projects described here were created for a real craft brewery while some were built for a hypothetical brewery.

If you're on the lookout for someone with my unique skillset, please reach out. I'm regularly on the lookout for interesting
opportunities and challenges.

Cheers!
